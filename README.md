# Design - UI Accessibility

## Process

To begin with I designed a front page for a fictinonal company. In this process I tried to make a design as clear and simple as possible. Then I read more on accessibility and checked the design with the Contrast plugin in Figma. There were problems with the contrast and text size. I made the necessary adjustments so that the design passes all the AAA tests at least in the Contrast plugin.
